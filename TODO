Make sure to add section about how to go from using ConfM to using JNC
How are the generated classes affected by non-config statements?
Make sure default values are used where appropriate for all types
Other substatement implications... (check-list!)
Add built in type for Inet-adresses to the JNC library
Remove TCPSession from the JNC library
Remove withDefaults from ConfDSession, replace with standard withDefaults
Consider changing how different types of sessions work
Fix existing javadoc in the JNC library
Add complete javadoc to the JNC library and clean up code
Check restrictions on leaf values in the JNC plugin
Add description, reference, status, etc. to class level javadoc
Consider removing duplicate key checks from generated classes
