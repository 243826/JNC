===========================
Verify correctness of this list
Rename JPyang to JNC
Take away max-elements-checks from add-methods
Update the README
Write structure template for User Manual, in LaTeX
Write examples and tests:
- Juniper
- Cisco?
- Generating classes from yang models with choice statements
- (all) built in types
- leaf-list (types, when, must, if-feature, ordered-by, status & units)
- augment
- notifications
- rpc
- deviation
- extension
- feature
- identity
- different revisiona of a single module
- capabilities (test/demo of library rather than plugin)
- deep package structures
- name collisions (particularly typedefs) and normalization
- inet-types and similar "standard-modules"
Write User Manual!
How are the generated classes affected by non-config statements?
Make sure default values are used where appropriate for all types
Other substatement implications... (check-list!)
Add built in type for Inet-adresses to the JNC library
Remove TCPSession from the JNC library
Remove withDefaults from ConfDSession, replace with standard withDefaults
Consider changing how different types of sessions work
Fix existing javadoc in the JNC library
Add complete javadoc to the JNC library and clean up code
Check restrictions on leaf values in the JNC plugin
Add description, reference, status, etc. to class level javadoc
Consider removing duplicate key checks from generated classes
