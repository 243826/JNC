* Dashes not removed from java class names
* Generated type references are not normalized
* No type classes are generated
* Converted class names are converted also in class comments (would be nice if
Jinterface was called interface when referring to the yang module)
* Module name is normalized in comments at beginning of file, but prefix is not.
Should be the other way around.
* Children names are normalized (perhaps this is ok?)
