* Dashes not removed from java class names
* Generated type references are not normalized
* No type classes are generated
* Converted class names are converted also in class comments (would be nice if
Jinterface was called interface when referring to the yang module)
* Module name is normalized in comments at beginning of file, but prefix is not.
Should be the other way around.
* Children names are normalized (perhaps this is ok?)
* No support for lists without a key (not a problem with this module)
* Correct generation of javadoc (not a top priority at this stage)
* Use os.pathsep instead of '/'
* State preconditions in all function specifications (which can be None, etc)
