                             ConfM DHCP Example
                             ==================

1. Purpose
==========

This example demonstrates a number of ConfM features while managing 2 DHCP
servers.

2. Topology
===========

This example uses two nodes as follows:

  * Our ConfM application.

  * Two NETCONF capable DHCP servers, in this particular example, 
    we assume that Tail-f ConfD is used.

For the sake of simplicity, the following simplification has been made:

Both nodes run on the same computer and communicates over the loopback
interface (i.e. remote host is set to "localhost" on both nodes). In a real
life situation, they would normally run on different computers. If your ConfD
node runs on a different machine than ConfM, there are a couple of additional
steps to take, please see section 5 below.

3. Prerequisites
================

In order to run this demonstration, you need the following:

  * One computer with Linux operating system installed.
  * ConfD version 2.5. or later.
  * ConfM version 1.2.3 or later.
  * Tools to build C programs, e.g. gcc, make.
  * Java version 1.4 or later.
  * ant program.

4. Building and Running the ConfM Introductory Example
======================================================

4.1 Building and Starting ConfD
===============================

Open a shell and set your current working directory to the directory where
your installation of ConfD resides:

  # cd <your confd installation dir>

Source the rc script in the ConfD root directory:

  # source <confd_dir>/confdrc

        or if you are using the tcsh:

  # source <confd_dir>/confdrc.tcsh

Source the rc script in the ConfM root directory
  # cd <your confm installation dir>
  # source ./confmrc

This sets environment variable CONFM_DIR to where
ConfM was installed. This is used by the ant build.xml to
find the ConfM jar files.

Then change directory 

  # cd ${CONFM_DIR}/examples/dhcp

Build the ConfD node and start it:

  # cd confd
  # make clean all start
  # cd ..

4.2 Building ConfM Node
=======================

Now we build the ConfM side of this example. First we generate Java classes
from the data model. The data model is the file dhcpd.cs located in the confd
subdirectory:

Set your current working directory to the directory where
this ConfM example resides:

  # cd ${CONFM_DIR}/examples/dhcp

and then:

  # ant

The subdirectory src/dhcp has been created and populatd with Java files.

4.3 Run the Example
===============================

Run this example by doing:

  # ant run

4.4 Stopping ConfD
===============================

After completing the examples above, stop ConfD as follows:
Build the ConfD node and start it:

  # cd confd
  # make stop
  # cd ..

5. ConfD and ConfM on different hosts
=====================================

You can also run the example above having ConfD and INM on separate
machines. If so, the following additional steps has to be made:
This is the required procedure for users using the win32 version of 
ConfM.

5.1 Building and Starting ConfD
===============================

On the machine where ConfD is installed, execute the steps above
that start ConfD

On the machine where ConfM runs, execute the ant script.

5.2. Building and Running the ConfM examples
===========================================

This example assumes that the ConfD server is running on the same
machine. Edit the file src/app/Main.java as follows:

There are two occurences of the following two lines line:

  left = new Device("left", duser, "localhost", 2022);
  right = new Device("right", duser, "localhost", 2023);


Replace the string "localhost" with the IP address or host name of your ConfD
server, e.g.:

  left = new Device("left", duser, "mydevice", 2022);
  right = new Device("right", duser, "mydevice", 2023);

or

  left = new Device("left", duser, "192.168.1.1", 2022);
  right = new Device("right", duser, "192.168.1.1", 2023);

Then rerun the ant script.
