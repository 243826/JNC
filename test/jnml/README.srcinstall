This is the ConfM source code base. It's all proprietary Tail-F systems
code. To build this code, just run the ant script at the top.
To run the tests, make sure CONFM_DIR and also CONFD_DIR are set
to point to your ConfM installation and ConfD installation respectively.
This is best done through the confmrc and confdrc source scripts 
respectively.

The build will not overwrite the jar files shipped with the release.
