Emil starts working at Tail-f and reads up on the NETCONF RFC 6241 and YANG RFC 6020. You should too if you intend to 
contribute to this project!

JPyang is born as a few lines of python code that integrates with pyang are written.

Empty initial commit of the repository. It will contain the source code for JPyang once it has been decided that 
it will be open source rather than proprietary to tail-f. The plugin itself is just a single python script (jpyang.py)
but the repository will contain a complete pyang configuration.
